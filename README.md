This is a way to package python files, so you can make pseudo-executables. The file format being used here is .par which is a fancy .zip file, so you can think of this as either a python analog to .jar or as a worse .egg file.

In the program itself, you can do two things, run .par files and make .par files. Running them is rather simple as all you need to do is click a button and a file. Making them is a bit more difficult but information is in README.txt. 

Minimum (tested) Requirements:

- Windows XP
- 2015 Visual CPP Redistributal (for the old runner)
- Python 3.4
- .NET 3.5 (for the new launcher)
